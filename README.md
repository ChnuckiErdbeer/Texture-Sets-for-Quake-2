# Texture-Sets-for-Quake-2
Anachronox, Daikatana, Gunman Chronicles, Blood.

I spent some time converting textures from various games to the q2 .wal format so they could be used for mapping and modding.

I converted all textures to the quake 2 palette sublty color grading them beforehand to reduce artefacts. I used the original textures from the games exept for Blood where I used the Blood HDX high res textures. (https://www.moddb.com/mods/blood-xhd/addons/blood-xhd)

I am aware that we are still in a lagal grey zone here. The textures for Daikatana are available for free at https://bitbucket.org/daikatana13/daikatana/wiki/Downloads so i think Ion storm or whoever owns their games nowadays is ok with non commercial distribution of the assets. Gunman Chrincles is pretty much abandonware so i think i'ts ok too. 

Still if you plan to map for Quake 2 using this textures, I think you should purchase the games. They are cheap, Gunman is free. And of course if you use the blood textures give credit to blood HDX. 
... give credit generally! :)
